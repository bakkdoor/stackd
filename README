The Stackd programming language
-------- Version 0.1.0 ---------

Stackd is a concatenative programming language, much like Factor and Forth.
It's somewhat an attempt to write a Factor implementation in Ruby.
In contrast to Factor, Stackd is interpreted and not compiled.
It's still in an early development phase, so many things aren't yet supported.


Here's a small list of features, that currently work already:

  * Word definitions
  * Most of Factors core words 
    (still some missing, but shouldn't be hard to implement)
  * Literals for
    * Booleans
    * Numbers (Integer & Float)
    * Strings
    * Arrays
    * Symbols (as in Ruby)
    * Quotations (e.g. first-class 'functions')
    * Regular Expressions (as in Ruby)
    * Hashtables (as in Ruby)
  * Two stacks to work with:
    * Data stack
      (used implicitly and most of the time)
    * Retain stack
      (used for temporarily storing values with predefined words
       e.g.: dip, keep etc.)
  * Very lean and simple syntax (as in Factor)
  * A simple REPL (see bin/repl)
  * Support for debug output via: bin/stackd filename.stackd --debug
    -> Outputs the parsed AST
  
What's partially implemented:
  * A generic object system (as in Factor)
    * Support for: 
      * Generic Words & Methods
      * Inheritance

What's still missing (and never might be implemented):
  * Private / read-only slots on objects / classes (and probably more)
  * Nice development tools, as Factor has them
  * Real debugger or walker
  * Many more features, you'll find in Factor

Some basic syntax rules:
  * All expressions / statements need to end with a semicolon (';')
  * Word definitions start with a colon (':')
  * Words can be named almost anything (as in Factor)
    e.g.: <<name>>, <a,b>, empty?, >!< etc.
  * For more information, have a look at:

Example code:
  * You can find some example code within the examples/ directory.
